## The dataset used for this project is fashion-MNIST.
## A CNN model is used to classify the images. 
#### The model structure and implementation was heavily inspired by a [Kaggle article](https://www.kaggle.com/mirhyun0508/2022-smarcle-ai-fashion-mnist-cnn) - see the script "CNN implemented from kaggle" for further details.
## The hyperparameters are updated using Bayesian Optimization.
